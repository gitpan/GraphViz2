Revision history for Perl extension GraphViz2.

1.09  Thu Jul 21 14:13:00 2011
	  - Patch parameter validation to allow for output image types such as png:gd etc.
	  	Only the prefix before the first ':' is validated.

1.08  Thu Jul 21 11:53:00 2011
	  - Change the behaviour of sub log() in GraphViz.pm. Now if called with $level eq 'error', it dies with $message.
	  - Change references to the color darkblue to blue, so it's compatible with both the X11 and SVG color schemes.
	  - Likewise change chartreuse to lawngreen.
	  - Rename scripts/generate.index.pl to scripts/generate.demo.pl, as a more meaningful name.
	  - Patch scripts/generate.demo.pl to accept the output image type as a command line parameter.
	  - Use this new feature to generate png files, and upload them to the demo site
	  	http://savage.net.au/Perl-modules/html/graphviz2/ even though png is often uglier than svg.
		I did this because Iceweasel (Firefox) V 3.5.16 was not displaying svgs within the index file,
		even though they are fine when displayed directly.
	  - Add scripts/generate.png.sh.
	  - Note: scripts/jointed.edges.pl must call dot with -Tpng:gd and not -Tpng, for unknown reasons.
	  - Make both scripts/generate.png.sh and scripts/generate.svg.sh redirect their log files to /tmp,
	  	so that we don't have to ship the logs, and also so they don't keep changing and hence need checking in.
	  - Remove ./dbi.schema.log from the distro.

1.07  Mon Jul  4 15:46:00 2011
	  - Use Date::Format to add a date stamp at the end of html/index.html, as output by generate.index.pl.

1.06  Tue Jun 28 11:10:00 2011
	  - Change usage of File::Temp -> newdir to fix problems testing on BSD-based systems.
	  - Add scripts/jointed.edges.pl.
	  	This demo - in Graph::Easy syntax - ships with Graph::Easy::Marpa.
	  - Re-write generate.index.pl to put all demo data (where available) and images on 1 page.
	  - Upload demo to (new location) http://savage.net.au/Perl-modules/html/graphviz2/index.html.

1.05  Fri Jun 24 12:40:00 2011
	  - Implement GraphViz2::Parse::Marpa, along with scripts/parse.marpa.pl and t/sample.marpa.1.dat.
	  	The output is html/parse.marpa.svg.
	  - Implement GraphViz2::Parse::STT, along with scripts/parse.stt.pl and t/sample.stt.1.dat.
	  	The output is html/parse.stt.svg.
	  - Add use File::Spec to t/test.t

1.04  Wed Jun 22  9:36:00 2011
	  - Reduce required version of File::Basename to 2.77, which came with Perl 5.10.1.
	  - Stop trying to write to t/html/, and use File::Temp for a directory instead.
	  	That way, it doesn't matter who owns t/html/, nor whether or not it's writable.

1.03  Sun Jun 19 16:27:00 2011
	  - Tweak File::Temp -> new to be File::Temp ->new(EXLOCK => 0) for BSD-based systems.

1.02  Fri Jun 17  8:36:00 2011
	  - Add the pre-requisite Log::Handler to Build.PL and Makefile.PL.
	  - Release HTML::Entities::Interpolate V 1.04 and Set::Array V 0.23 to CPAN.
	  - Add README file.
	  - Clean up TODO list.

1.01  Wed Jun 15 15:00:00 2011
	  - Quote cluster/subgraph names so they may contain weird characters.
	  - Add method dependency(data => $depend) to GraphViz2.pm, which accepts an object of type
	  	Algorithm::Dependency. See scripts/dependency.pl and html/dependency.svg.
	  - Add GraphViz2::Parse::ISA, and scripts/parse.isa.pl, and the t/lib/Parent hierarchy.

1.00  Wed Jun 15 14:26:00 2011
	  - This is a re-write of GraphViz. The method parameter lists are incompatible.
	  	Sorry, but it now supports all options and attributes in Graphviz V 2.23.6.
	  - Rewrite GraphViz, GraphViz::Data::Grapher, GraphViz::Parse::RecDescent, GraphViz::Parse::Yacc and GraphViz::Parse::Yapp.
	  	The core code of *::RecDescent, *::Yacc and *::Yapp has been copied from GraphViz, with tiny changes.
	  - GraphViz2::Data::Grapher uses Tree::DAG_Node to hold information, before calling external plotting programs.
	  	The tree is available for you to process whether or not you actually plot the graph.
	  - GraphViz::Regex renamed GraphViz2::Parse::Regexp.
	  - GraphViz::XML renamed GraphViz2::Parse::XML. And it uses XML::Tiny by default.
	  	One demo shows how to use XML::Bare instead.
	  - All new documentation.
	  - All new demos, in scripts/*.pl. These are documented in GraphViz's POD.
	  - All demo output included, in html/*.html and html/*.svg.
