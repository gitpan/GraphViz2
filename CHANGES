	  - Tweak File::Temp -> new to be File::Temp ->new(EXLOCK => 0) for BSD-bases systems.

	  - Add the pre-requisite Log::Handler to Build.PL and Makefile.PL.
	  - Release HTML::Entities::Interpolate V 1.04 and Set::Array V 0.23 to CPAN.
	  - Add README file.
	  - Clean up TODO list.

1.01  Wed Jun 15 15:00:00 2011
	  - Quote cluster/subgraph names so they may contain weird characters.
	  - Add method dependency(data => $depend) to GraphViz2.pm, which accepts an object of type
	  	Algorithm::Dependency. See scripts/dependency.pl and html/dependency.svg.
	  - Add GraphViz2::Parse::ISA, and scripts/parse.isa.pl, and the t/lib/Parent hierarchy.

1.00  Wed Jun 15 14:26:00 2011
	  - This is a re-write of GraphViz. The method parameter lists are incompatible.
	  	Sorry, but it now supports all options and attributes in Graphviz V 2.23.6.
	  - Rewrite GraphViz, GraphViz::Data::Grapher, GraphViz::Parse::RecDescent, GraphViz::Parse::Yacc and GraphViz::Parse::Yapp.
	  	The core code of *::RecDescent, *::Yacc and *::Yapp has been copied from GraphViz, with tiny changes.
	  - GraphViz2::Data::Grapher uses Tree::DAG_Node to hold information, before calling external plotting programs.
	  	The tree is available for you to process whether or not you actually plot the graph.
	  - GraphViz::Regex renamed GraphViz2::Parse::Regexp.
	  - GraphViz::XML renamed GraphViz2::Parse::XML. And it uses XML::Tiny by default.
	  	One demo shows how to use XML::Bare instead.
	  - All new documentation.
	  - All new demos, in scripts/*.pl. These are documented in GraphViz's POD.
	  - All demo output included, in html/*.html and html/*.svg.
