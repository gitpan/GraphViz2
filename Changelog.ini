- This is a re-write of GraphViz. The method parameter lists are incompatible.
Sorry, but it now supports all options and attributes in Graphviz V 2.23.6.
- Rewrite GraphViz, GraphViz::Data::Grapher, GraphViz::Parse::RecDescent, GraphViz::Parse::Yacc and GraphViz::Parse::Yapp.
The core code of *::RecDescent, *::Yacc and *::Yapp has been copied from GraphViz, with tiny changes.
- GraphViz2::Data::Grapher uses Tree::DAG_Node to hold information, before calling external plotting programs.
The tree is available for you to process whether or not you actually plot the graph.
- GraphViz::Regex renamed GraphViz2::Parse::Regexp.
- GraphViz::XML renamed GraphViz2::Parse::XML. And it uses XML::Tiny by default.
One demo shows how to use XML::Bare instead.
- All new documentation.
- All new demos, in scripts/*.pl. These are documented in GraphViz's POD.
- All demo output included, in html/*.html and html/*.svg.
